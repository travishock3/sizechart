# Cargo Jeans Size Chart

This repository contains a single-page Cargo Jeans size chart experience with inline editing, unit toggling, export tools, and a measurement guide.

## Running the page
Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser to interact with the chart.

## Automated tests
Run the automated checks to ensure the critical UI scaffolding and seed data stay intact:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```
